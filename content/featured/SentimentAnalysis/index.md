This Python project tackles sentiment analysis with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach. It preprocesses review data, then leverages KNN to classify sentiment by finding the most similar reviews in a training set. It utilizes machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and NLTK to achieve 80+% accuracy in determining if a review is positive or negative.
