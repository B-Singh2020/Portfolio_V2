An Android quiz app I built to test and enhance understanding of unsigned and signed integer representations. It dynamically generates questions with varying bit widths (8, 10, 12) and challenges users through multiple-choice and text input formats. The app provides immediate feedback and tracks progress thru a practice and quiz mode, making it an engaging learning tool for aspiring bitwise masters.
